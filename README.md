# grid-to-plot

This project enables you to fully custom design a github profile contribution grid.

The grid is bound by the styling of github's front page, so the grid is always 7 pixels high. The width however is fully up to you.

---
> Currently you can enter an array in the `vm.demoArray`, with values ranging 0-4 and it will generate a grid filled in to match. 
>
> If you want a different colour scheme, you can change which colours show up by changing the hex-codes in the `vm.colourScheme`. 
> By defaut it is set to the colours you see on the profile page (those beautiful greens).

> ToDos;
> - Fix the output from the grid in the textbox to output the numbers not hex-codes.
> - Generate changes from the textbox in the grid.
> - Export custom grid to a script -> user downloadable file which will generate the contribution grid on your page.
